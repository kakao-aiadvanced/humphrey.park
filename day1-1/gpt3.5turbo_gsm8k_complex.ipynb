Sarah only had 50 social media followers at the start of the year, but she gained 90 new followers the first week, a third of that in the second week, and a third of that in the third week.  After three weeks, how many social media followers did the girl with the most total followers have?\n",
      "Let's think step by step\n",
      "After one week, Susy has 100+40 = 140 followers.\n",
      "In the second week, Susy gains 40/2 = 20 new followers.\n",
      "In the third week, Susy gains 20/2 = 10 new followers.\n",

He rearranged five of these boxes into packages of six highlighters each and sold them for $3 per package. He sold the rest of the highlighters separately at the rate of three pens for $2. How much profit did he make in total, in dollars?\n",
      "Let's think step by step\n",
      "Sam bought 12 boxes x $10 = $120 worth of highlighters.\n",
      "He bought 12 * 30 = 360 highlighters in total.\n",
      "Sam then took 5 boxes × 6 highlighters/box = 30 highlighters.\n",
      "He sold these boxes for 5 * $3 = $15\n",
      "After selling these 5 boxes there were 360 - 30 = 330 highlighters remaining.\n",

What percent of the population of the school do not like to play basketball if the ratio of the male to female students is 3:2 and there are 1000 students?\n",
